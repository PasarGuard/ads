When a node reaches its limit, it automatically gets disabled to prevent excessive data usage charges. Nodes can be re-enabled manually or reset at the beginning of each billing cycle.\nUse case: Prevents unexpected high bills from nodes that consume more data than anticipated, giving you better control over infrastructure costs.",
